#Example config file

#Kind of hardcoded as it is right now. Will fix this.
#Every Nmax-2 coordinated splits one water. (maybe add possibility to choose custom splitting fraction later)
#Not currently possible to choose different metals. Will add this.

# Usage
atom Ti: high coordinated
    water: 0.5
    hydroxyl: 0.5

atom Ti: low coordinated
    fraction: 0.5

end

# high coordinated are Nmax - 1 coordinated atoms
# low coordinated are Nmax - 2 coordinated atoms
